## Requirements

See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Running the app

```bash
#  Local development
pnpm install
pnpm dev

pnpm build # build for production
pnpm preview # preview prod build
```

## Contributing

Deployments to the `main` branch will be deployed to the production environment in cloudflare.

## Personal Notes

- This took me a good bit longer to develop since I wanted to try out some new things:
  - Tanstack Query (formerly React Query)
  - Tanstack Router
  - React Suspense
